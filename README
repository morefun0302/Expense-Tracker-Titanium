Expense Tracker Titanium

This is a sample mobile application built with Appcelerator Titanium Mobile. Not
intended to run as production level code. Please do not hold your breath waiting
to be impressed with this code. This is supposed to be a very basic DB CRUD app,
nothing fancy or impressive.

This repo is a Titanium Studio project. If you would like to work with this code,
be sure to install Titanium Studio which can be downloaded at the following URL:
